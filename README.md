# Task-2_FEDIS
# ðŸš– Green Taxis Task â€“ FEDIS

This repository contains work on the **Green Taxis dataset** as part of the FEDIS tasks.  
The project is divided into three main stages:

## ðŸ”¹ Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries  
   - Handled missing and inconsistent values  
   - Standardized formats for analysis  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Statistical summaries of key features  
   - Visualizations to uncover patterns and distributions  
   - Insights into trip characteristics  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created new features to enhance dataset usability  
   - Transformed variables for better representation  
   - Prepared data for potential modeling  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `data/` â†’ Raw and cleaned datasets (if included)  
- `notebooks/` â†’ Jupyter notebooks for each stage  
- `src/` â†’ Helper scripts (cleaning, EDA, feature engineering)  
- `README.md` â†’ Project documentation  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
